# PhonePe-Pulse-Data-Visualization
Analyzed and visualized transaction data from PhonePe Pulse using Python and Tableau. 
Technologies are  Python, Pandas, MySQL,
 mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.
 Domain  is Fintech
  Problem Statement:
 ThePhonepepulseGithub repositorycontainsa largeamount of data related to
 variousmetricsandstatistics.Thegoal istoextract thisdataandprocessit toobtain
 insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
 The solution must include the following steps:
 1. ExtractdatafromthePhonepepulseGithubrepositorythroughscriptingand
 clone it..
 2. Transformthedataintoasuitableformatandperformanynecessarycleaning
 and pre-processing steps.
 3. Insert thetransformeddata intoaMySQLdatabaseforefficientstorageand
 retrieval.
 4. CreatealivegeovisualizationdashboardusingStreamlitandPlotlyinPython
 to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
 5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
 6. Provideat least 10different dropdownoptions for users toselectdifferent
 facts and figures to display on the dashboard.
 Approach:
 1. Dataextraction:Clone theGithubusingscriptingtofetchthedatafromthe
 PhonepepulseGithubrepositoryandstoreit inasuitableformatsuchasCSV
 or JSON.
 2. Data transformation: Useascripting languagesuchasPython, alongwith
 librariessuchasPandas, tomanipulateandpre-processthedata.Thismay
 includecleaningthedata,handlingmissingvalues,andtransformingthedata
 into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
 3. Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library inPython to
 connect toaMySQLdatabaseand insert the transformeddatausingSQL
 commands.
4. Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create
 an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map
 functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used
 to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to
 select different facts and figures to display.
 5. Data retrieval: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the
 MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in
 the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
 6. Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test
 the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it
 accessible to users.
 This approach leverages the power of Python and its numerous libraries to extract,
 transform, and analyze data, and to create a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing
 the insights obtained from the data.

 Results:
  The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays
 information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive
 and visually appealing manner. The dashboard will have at least 10 different
 dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. The data
 will be stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and the dashboard will be
 dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.
  Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate
 the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. The dashboard will
 provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse
 Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.
